1	hippocampus_TemporalLobe.png	Temporal Lobe	The lateral-most lobe of the cerebral cortex. The temporal lobe on each side of the brain is delineated anteriorly from the frontal and parietal lobes by the lateral sulcus (also called the sylvian fissure). Named the temporal lobe as it lies deep to the temporal bone of the skull, it also lies mostly in the middle cranial fossa. The temporal lobe, especially its medial region, has long been associated with recognition and memory - damage to it affects declarative memory (recalling facts like dates or names) and its degeneration is associated with dementia. The hippocampus and related regions are found in the medial temporal lobe - the Parahippocampal Gyrus (see "Parahippocampal Gyrus") is the most medial gyrus of the temporal lobe, beside it the more primitive allocortex (3-4 cortical layers) folds in on itself to form the hippocampal formation, consisting of the hippocampus proper (CA1, 2 and 3), dentate gyrus, and subiculum. (For more details see the individual regions).	N/A	N/A

4	hippocampus_Subiculum.png	Subiculum	The Subiculum is a component of the hippocampal formation, consisting of 3-layered allocortex. It is the cortex between the hippocampus proper and the parahippocampal gyrus, carrying the efferent projections from area CA1 of the hippocampus. This is one of two output pathways of the hippocampus proper, the other being via the fimbria-fornix.	Temporal lobe	N/A
8	hippocampus_HippocampusProper.png	Hippocampus Proper	The hippocampus proper is a part of the hippocampal formation which consists of the cornus ammonis regions 1, 2, and 3. This area of the hippocampal formation consists of 3-layered allocortex and can be found in the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle. As a result of its development, it is folded into the medial temporal lobe, being continuous with its neocortex via the subiculum and its connections to the juxtallocortex of the parahippocampal gyrus.

32	hippocampus_ParahippocampalGyrus.png	Parahippocampal Gyrus	The Parahippocampal Gyrus consists anteriorly of the pyriform cortex (includes uncus and primary olfactory cortex), and posteriorly of the entorhinal cortex (see "entorhinal cortex"). It is also part of the transitional cortex between allocortex and neocortex, consisting of 4-5 cortical layers. It is also continuous with the cingulate gyrus posteriorly.	Temporal lobe	N/A
